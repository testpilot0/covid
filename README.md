# Predicting Peptide for Vaccine Candidate Solution

This is an interim development repo for Predicting Peptide for Vaccine Candidate Solution.

  Peptide_Prediction_BigQuery_Demo.ipynb - explore peptide data and run BQML to predict peptide bindings. Thi notebook is well documented.

There are two others notebooks which will need some more documentations

  AI_Pipeline_MHC_Peptide.ipynb -provide steps to deploy and run AI pipeline for peptide binding.

It allow data scientist quickly plug and explore various models  

(see module: https://github.com/jarokaz/peptide-predict/blob/master/mch_pipeline/model.py  line 87-84)

and run the entire pipeline with a single command. That allows data scientist run multiple computation experiments in parallel and explore various models for outcome prediction.

Third pipile in initial stage of development: 

  COVID_Mutated.ipynb
It is a template to explore virus mutations.
